According to the City of Chicago Data Portal, despite a couple of fluctuations, there is a general downward trend in the number of heroin related arrests in Chicago over the past decade. The lowest arrests appeared in 2015, with a 2.7% decrease from the previous year. 

In Austin, a community in the west side where the open heroin market has been flourishing for years, the number is also going down. In 2003 and 2004, there were nearly 2,000 arrests each year, while since 2011 the number no longer surpassed 1,500.Â In 2015, it dropped to a new low of 830.
